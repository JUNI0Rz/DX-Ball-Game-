 Assembly Language(using only MASM assembler)
Implementation of DX Ball Game
1. Project Overview:
Develop a simple DX Ball game using assembly language. The game will be a classic breakoutstyle game where a ball bounces off a paddle, breaking bricks on the screen. The project aims
to enhance programming skills in assembly language and provide a hands-on experience in
game development.
2. Objectives:
• Implement a graphical interface for the game using assembly language.
• Develop the game logic, including ball movement, paddle control, and brick collision.
• Incorporate features such as scoring and game over conditions.
• Provide a visually appealing and user-friendly gaming experience.
3.Features:
• Ball and paddle movement using assembly language.
• Brick collision detection and removal.
• Scoring system.
• Game over conditions.
• Simple graphics.
4. Tools and Technologies:
• Assembly language (x86 architecture).
• Suitable development environment and assembler (e.g., MASM).
• Simple graphics library or direct VGA programming for graphical representation.
5. Conclusion:
This project will provide an excellent opportunity to enhance assembly language programming skills
while creating an entertaining DX Ball game. The focus on simplicity will make the project accessible for
learners while providing a foundation for more complex game development in the future.# DX-Ball-Game-
